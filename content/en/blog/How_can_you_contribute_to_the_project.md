There are several ways to contribute to the project.

<!--more-->

## Sharing

For me, this is the most important point.

Sharing may seem minimal, but it actually makes a difference. 
 
If you pass it on to your friends, family, or close people, you will be helping the message reach much further. If everyone does it, the reach can be enormous."

## Content Editing

You can assist with the correction, expansion, and translation of the content (including text and images).

 I am currently searching for an accessible and convenient way for everyone to participate, since performing Forks and Pull Requests through GitHub is not a feasible option for all users.

## Marketing or Design

I am not a designer, nor do I have experience in marketing, so any help in this regard will be more than welcome.

## Financial Support

Financial help is also valuable and greatly appreciated. However, I have put it last because I understand that not everyone can donate, but everyone can collaborate in many other equally important ways.

## Do you have another idea?

This is everything I can think of for now, but if you think there is something else that you can help with, don't hesitate to write to me.

I am open to suggestions and delighted to receive any kind of contribution.

To understand human desire, we must first identify what trait we share as a species.

One of the phenomena that manifests similarly anywhere in the contemporary world is the economy. To deepen this idea, it is useful to begin by defining what we understand by economy.

## What is Economics?

One of the definitions offered by the RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) is the following: 

- economics: *3. f. Science that studies the most effective methods to satisfy human material needs, through the use of scarce goods.* 

Link to the RAE page: https://dle.rae.es/econom%C3%ADa

In simpler terms, we can understand economics as the exchange of scarce goods to satisfy our needs. 

Within this definition, there is an element that stands out and that I find especially interesting lately: the exchange with **scarce goods.**

## Money and Time

From an almost romantic perspective, we can say that money is the representation of the most scarce and precious good that each of us has: time.
If we understand this parallel, we will see that the way we use money has a direct impact on our life and, by extension, on our time.

You can waste your time or you can find ways to get ahead: helping your future self, reducing obligations (loans, debts), investing to grow your savings, or investing in personal growth.

## Content and structure

You might be wondering:  
>**"Okay, but how do I do it? How do I grow my savings and get ahead of time in my favor?"**  

Precisely, this series of modules (or as I like to call them, notes) seeks to answer those questions.  
I will talk about stock market investing. Although I am not a professional nor do I have a degree in economics, I have tried to build this educational material in the most rigorous and documented way possible.
I always cite the sources of the data I use so you can verify them yourself and, if necessary, correct me.

The structure of these modules is designed so that anyone, regardless of their age or prior knowledge, can understand (or begin to understand) what stock market investing is and how it works.

Or at least, that was the intention 🙂

## What will you be able to do after reading the content?

If we simplify it to the maximum, you will know how to answer these three key questions:

- Where to buy?
- What to buy?
- When to buy or sell?

The idea is simple: I want to share with you the knowledge necessary so you can perform deep and well-founded analyses of companies.

You will see how to evaluate:

- Qualitative aspects: quality of management team, competitive advantages, market positioning, etc.
- Quantitative aspects: analysis of financial statements, profit generation, reasonable estimation of a stock's price, etc.

All this with a clear objective:
**That you can make informed, coherent, and sustainable investment decisions over time.**

Let's get started. 🚀💪

👋 Welcome to Sofia Capital

## What is Sofia Capital?

Sofia Capital is an open knowledge project about finance, created to combat misinformation and false investment gurus. Here I share, for free, my personal notes and learnings acquired through books and courses, with the aim of helping those who are starting from scratch. 

It is not a course nor professional advice, but a structured compilation of everything I have learned, and that I feel the need to share with you.

I won't bore you anymore 🙂. If you want to know more about the project and how you can help (if you're interested and it's possible for you), you can continue reading on the following page:

[**Read more about the project**](/about/_index.md)

If what you want is to go straight to the notes, simply click on the button that says *"Module 1 - Introduction"*. You'll find it just below this text, on the right.

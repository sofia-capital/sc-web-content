## What is Sofia Capital?

Sofia Capital is an Open Educational Resources and Open Knowledge project focused on the world of finance. 

It was born with a very clear idea: to combat charlatans and false investment professionals who, taking advantage of the lack of financial education, end up harming working people and robbing them of the opportunity to build a stable and prosperous economic life.

I want to be completely transparent: I am not a financial analyst, I did not study economics, and I do not offer professional advice. Everything I share here comes from books, courses, and self-study. 

Like anyone, I can make mistakes, so if you see something that is not coherent or poorly formulated, I ask you to correct me. 

I have tried to structure the knowledge I use in my day-to-day life so that others, who like me are starting from scratch, have a better starting point.

Sofia Capital is not a course, nor does it pretend to be one. It is a compilation of personal notes and materials that I felt the need to share. If this content can help you better understand finance, question unrealistic promises, and make more informed decisions, then the project fulfills its purpose.

## This Project Needs You

I currently manage this ambitious project on my own.
So if you also see the usefulness of content like this, I wholeheartedly ask for your help.
And I'm not just referring to financial help (which, to be honest, wouldn't hurt either 😅), but especially in aspects such as correction, translation, or content expansion.
